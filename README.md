# School-minecraft-server

So I am a 13 yo 8th grader and I recently got into networking,servers,linux,yk all that jazz,and I did this sysadmin experiment where I ran a school Minecraft server for about 2 weeks to see player behavior,complaints,etc. To see what I could fix and make the experience better for the users. And I am making this guide so if you wanted to make your own 24/7 minecraft server you could! making use of old hardware.

# Step 1 Installing the OS.
You will need an old computer or laptop you don't use really anything with a decent amount of ram works. ( > 6 gigabytes of ram)

You will then need to flash a USB thumb drive or a CD/DVD with an image of the Debian 13 distribution of Linux. 

There are plenty of guides online on how to boot into the installer.

Once in the installer you want to click on graphical install or use enter along with the arrow keys.

Next you will want to select a language. (in my case I chose english)

Then select your location since I live in Mexico I obviously chose Mexico but make sure to choose your location.

When you are asked to configure a keyboard layout you will want to choose your keyboard layout if you live in the US then choose American english or really just depending on your keyboard.

Before going on to the next step you will want to connect you future server to ethernet for best performance if you don't have acces to an ethernet port, you can buy cheap $10 USB to lan adapters on amazon or your local best buy.

You will now be asked for a hostname for your server, so how other devices will recognize your server. ex: your router will recognize your server as the hostname you choose.

Next you will be asked for a domain name, you can just skip this and click continue.

Next, for the root password choose something you will remember because the root use basically has all the privileges kind of like the admin account, If you leave it empty, the main account will be able to run root commands by using the command sudo which I recommend.

Alright listen up this step is crucial set up your username and password make them something easy like your name and write it down on a sheet of paper because you will need this.

Now choose your time zone since I live in border to california, I will choose pacific.

In partition disk choose guided-use entire disk, and select your disk DO NOT SELECT YOUR FLASH DRIVE, SELECT YOUR DISK.

DISCLAIMER: YOUR DISK WILL BE WIPED TO INSTALL THE OS SO INSTALL AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Next choose all files in one partition and click finish partitioning and write changes to disk.

Now wait a couple minutes for the base system to install, watch some youtube, relax.

Next in the package manager keep it as no and continue.

Now choose your country or the region closest to you so the mirror works better.

Next choose deb.debian.org and in proxy information leave it blank and continue.

When that's done keep popularity contest as no and continue.

In software selection unselect GNOME and Debian desktop enviorment and only leave standard system utilities checked and SSH server.
Wait a couple of minutes for the sysetm to install packages and come back later.


On Grub bootloader select yes and continue. Then choose your disk not flash drive, disk.

Now you should see INstallation complete, now remove your installation media and Continue.

In the GNU/GRUB screen click on Debian GNU/LINUX.

(sorry I haven't updated the repo in a while but I've got school and I really am busy all day I don't have time to do basically anything besides homework so yeah)

# Step 2 Logging into your server and Installing packages.

Next log into your server it will ask for a login, here you have to type the username you chose.

Next when it asks for your password, yknow, just type in your password.

Next up, type: sudo apt update in the terminal once you are logged in.

it will ask for your password and type it in.

What sudo basically is, it's a command to run other commands as the root user (or admin) without having to log into the root user.

Now you wanna type "sudo apt install curl" type y when prompted and let it finish.

Here comes the fun part, almost there...

type in this exact command

curl -fsSL https://get.casaos.io | sudo bash

After that wait a couple of minutes for it to finish installing and come back once it's done.

You will now see (casaos is running at (192.16x.xxx)

You want to type in that Ip into your browser.

Once it loads, create your user.

after that go into the app store and install "Crafty Controller"
once crafty loads you want to click on forgot password and after that go back to the home screen without closing crafty, and click on the three dots on crafty controller and settings, after that at the top right click terminal and logs, then logs and copy the recovery password it usually looks like this: K98j-90wjh...

After all of that you will want to go back to crafty then put the password in and where it says user type in "anti-lockout-user".

You will be logged in and it's pretty clear how to set a passwd. (default user is admin)

When you're done click on create new server and select java and select papermc as server type and the latest version.

Choose Minecraft servers, choose your server name and then choose your minimum ram and max (I recommend minimum 1 gb and max 6gb)

After that click on start and accept the EULA.

Now go back to the appstore to install Playit Docker Web ( I used to use port forwarding but my bum ahh ISP shut down the port forwarding for some reason so yeah I gotta use tunnels now... Shoutout to Infinitum/Telnor)

create a playit.gg account

Then set up the agent, then set up the tunnel.

choose minecraft Java servers.
follow steps.

you will now get an IP at the top of the tunnel for example: (fitness-objectives.gl.joinmc.link) something along those lines.

now insert that IP into your minecraft Java edition and vuala, minecraft server.
